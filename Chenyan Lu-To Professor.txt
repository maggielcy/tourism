[SIPA Coding INAFU6003] Assignment Submission-Chenyan Lu


Dear Professor:

My github links are as follows, and I have also uploaded both zip files in the dropbox in Coursework:

Weekend project: https://github.com/maggielcy/diary
Final project: https://github.com/maggielcy/tourism

p.s.
I used {entry_params = params["entry"]} instead of {entry_params = params["entry"].permit("title", "contents")} for "create" and"update" the entry, and they works.

Thank you so much for the 3-day course, and I really enjoyed it!

Best regards,
Chenyan Lu
